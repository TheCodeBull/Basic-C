I am Putting here Everything from scratch .
That I learned during my self-taught coding journey .
The basics took me <1 week in a blitzkreig speed.
While i learned complete language in <2 month . 
Then i spend another 2 month on project-usage and competitive coding .
And also simultanosly got into C++ and other languages(JAVA,HTML/CSS) .
